Apple PSI system

This document describes the constraints that drove the design of the Apple private set intersection (PSI) protocol. Apple PSI makes use of a variant of PSI we call private set intersection with associated data (PSI-AD), and an extension called threshold private set intersection with associated data (tPSI-AD). We describe a protocol that satisfies the constraints, and analyze its security. The context and motivation for the Apple PSI system are described on the main project site.
